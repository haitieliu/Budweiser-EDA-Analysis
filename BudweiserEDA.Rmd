## Introduction

- Welcome to the EDA with Budweiser, in this analysis we will dive deep into beer and breweries data across the United States, analyzing different metrics given such as ABV (Alcohol by volume) and IBU (International bitterness level), using these metrics to classify different craft beer types, expand our research into top performing breweries, the most craft-beer-friendly states and most popular craft beer style in the country.

- Then we will take another deep dive into overall craft beer market, given what we know about Budweiser, where do we see potential opportunities and improvements so our insights could turn into business solutions

## Prepration
 loading needed packages
```{r setup, message=FALSE}
#load all library needed
library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(caret)
library(e1071)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(class)
library(GGally)
library(RANN)
```

 Merge two data sets together

```{r}

file1beer=read.csv(file="Beers.csv",header=TRUE)  #loading first data
file2brewery=read.csv(file="Breweries.csv",header=TRUE) #loading second data
all=full_join(file1beer,file2brewery,by =c("Brewery_id"="Brew_ID")) #full join them together
```

## Data cleaning

-   In this section we will perform data cleansing.
-   Addressing missing values
-   We will implement different methods for IBU and ABV
    -   ABV: Replace missing values with the arithmetic mean
    -   IBU: Replace missing values using KnnImpute
    
```{r}
#address missing values
 #replacing all NA values with average ABV
 
 all$ABV=replace_na(all$ABV,mean(all[!is.na(all$ABV),]$ABV))
   
 #Clearing NA values using KNN
 knn_imp_model <- preProcess(all %>%
                          select(ABV,IBU),
                            method = c("knnImpute"),
                            k = 20,
                            knnSummary = mean)

all <- predict(knn_imp_model, all,na.action = na.pass)
 
procNames <- data.frame(col = names(knn_imp_model$mean), mean = knn_imp_model$mean, sd = knn_imp_model$std)
for(i in procNames$col){
 all[i] <- all[i]*knn_imp_model$std[i]+knn_imp_model$mean[i] 
}


##cleaning Data

brewerybystate=table(file2brewery$State)
brewerybystate= data.frame(brewerybystate)
colnames(brewerybystate)[1]="state"
brewerybystate$Freq=as.double(brewerybystate$Freq)
brewerybystate$state=as.character(brewerybystate$state)
all$State=str_replace_all(all$State," ","")
brewerybystate$state=str_replace_all(brewerybystate$state," ","")

```

- After Knn Impute, we have a much more cohesive data set

## Compute the median alcohol content and IBU for each state.

- We made a bar chart to compare
- plot a bar chart with median ABV on the Y-axis and States on the X-axis
- plot the same chart with top 5 States that have most breweries.

```{R}
#calculating median alcohol content
#calculate median
alls=all %>%
  group_by(State) %>% #group by state
  summarise(median_ABV = median(ABV), median_IBU = median(IBU)) 


#use ggplot to plot the chart
theme_set(theme_classic())
p2=ggplot(alls, aes(x = State, y = median_ABV)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill=median_IBU)) +
  ggtitle("Median ABV and IBU by State") +
  xlab("State") +
  ylab("Median ABV") +
  scale_fill_gradient( low = "#132B43",
  high = "#56B1F7",
  space = "Lab",
  na.value = "grey50",
  guide = "colourbar",
  aesthetics = "fill", name="Median IBU") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

ggplotly(p2)

  filter(State=="CO" | State=="CA" |State=="MI" |State=="OR" | State=="TX")%>%#group by state
  summarise(median_ABV = median(ABV), median_IBU = median(IBU)) #calculate median

p3=ggplot(statesmedian, aes(x = State, y = median_ABV, fill = median_IBU)) + #use ggplot to plot the chart

ggplotly(p3)

#calculating using mean

  group_by(State) %>% #group by state
  filter(State=="CO" | State=="CA" |State=="MI" |State=="OR" | State=="TX")%>%
  summarise(mean_ABV = mean(ABV), mean_IBU = mean(IBU)) #calculate mean

```
#### Observation:
- DC has the highest median IBU
- KS has the lowest median IBU
- WV has the highest median ABV
- UT has the lowest median ABV
- TX has the lowest median IBU among biggest 5 states
- All big 5 states have median ABV between 5% - 6%


<br />

## Most AVB and IBU beer for each state

<br />

- plot the chart with longitude and latitude of each city, and notate on the plot with interactive information.
- plot the chart with the top 5 ABV Beer and its location
- plot the chart with the top 5 IBU Beer and its location
```{R}

```

#### Observation:
- Top ABV:
    - 1. Lee Hill Series Vol. 5 - Belgian Style Quadrupel Ale: Boulder, Colorado,ABV: 0.128
    - 2. London Balling: Evansville,Kentucky, ABV: 0.125
    - 3. Csar, Louisville: Indiana, ABV: 0.120
    - 4. Lee Hill Series Vol. 4 - Manhattan Style Rye Ale: Boulder,Colorado, ABV: 0.104
    - 5. 4Beans, From: Brooklyn: New York, ABV: 0.100
- Top IBU:
    - 1. Bitter Bitch Imperial IPA: Astoria, Oregon, IBU: 138
    - 2. Troopers Alley IPA: Abingdon, VA, IBU: 135
    - 3. Dead-Eye DIPA: Gloucester, MA, IBU: 130
    - 4. Bay of Bengal Double IPA (2014): Cincinnati, OH, IBU: 126
    - 5. Heady Topper: Waterbury, VT, IBU: 120





## Summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable
- Plot the distribution of ABV variable
- Classify beer into "ALE","IPA", "Other"
- Observe the distribution to look for insights
```{r, include=TRUE, cache = FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.

#creating a category
all$Category="Other"


#classify all IPA as IPA
indexIPA=grep("IPA",all$Name.x) 
IPA=all[indexIPA,]
all[indexIPA,"Category"]="IPA"

#classify all Ale as Ale
indexAle=grep("Ale",all$Name.x) 
Ale=all[indexAle,]
all[indexAle,"Category"]="Ale"


#Statistics 

p5=all%>%
  select(IBU,ABV,Category)%>%
  ggpairs(aes(color=Category))+ggtitle("Summary Stats For ABV/IBU")

ggplotly(p5)

```
#### Observation: According to the histogram we can conclude that the data seems slight right-skewed.
 
 
 

## Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? 
- Plot IBU on the x-axis and ABV on the Y-axis
- classify beer into "ALE","IPA", "Other"
- Draw a regression line using geom_smooth to observe the relationship

```{r, include=TRUE, cache = FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Finding out linear relationship between IBU and ABV

all %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=IBU,y=ABV,color=Category))+
  geom_point()+geom_smooth()+
  ggtitle("Relationship between IBU and ABV")+
  ggthemes::theme_economist()
```

#### Observation: Given the chart above, there is a positive correlation between ABV and IBU




## Difference with respect to IBU and ABV, IPA and ALE
- classify beer into IPA and ALE
- Using KNN (K nearest neighbor) to verify the relationship
- Tuning K to find out the max accuracy
- Conclude accuracy

```{r}

#creating a category
all$Category="other"

#classify all IPA as IPA
indexIPA=grep("IPA",all$Name.x) 
IPA=all[indexIPA,]
all[indexIPA,"Category"]="IPA"

#classify all Ale as Ale
indexAle=grep("Ale",all$Name.x) 
Ale=all[indexAle,]
all[indexAle,"Category"]="Ale"

#Filter only IPA and ALE
IPAandAle=all %>%      
  filter(Category=="IPA" |Category== "Ale")

#classification=knn.cv(IPAandAle[c(3,4)],IPAandAle$Category,k=3) #find out max accuracy
#confusionMatrix(table(classification,IPAandAle$Category))


MaxAccuracy=numeric(100) #find out max accuracy

for (i in 1:100){
  classification=knn.cv(IPAandAle[c(3,4)],IPAandAle$Category,k=i)
  CM=confusionMatrix(table(classification,IPAandAle$Category))
  MaxAccuracy[i]=CM$overall[1]
}

plot(MaxAccuracy) #find out max accuracy

#accuracy is the highest when k =3, use k=3 as classification 

classification=knn.cv(IPAandAle[c(3,4)],IPAandAle$Category,k=3) #find out max accuracy
confusionMatrix(table(classification,IPAandAle$Category))

p6=ggplot(IPAandAle,aes(x=IBU,y=ABV,color=Category))+geom_point()+ggthemes::theme_economist()+ggtitle(" IPA VS. Ale")

ggplotly(p6)


```
#### Observation: using KKN, we can see that k=3 our model has the most accuracy,clearly IPA tends to have higher IBU and ABV level, while ALE has lower IBU and ABV level.

## How many breweries are presented in each state?
- Looking for state/states that have the most number breweries

```{R}
# count how many brewery are present in each state
#using raw data to create a data set contains, state and freq and lot it with US map


p1=plot_usmap(data = brewerybystate, regions = "state", values = "Freq", color = "#56B4E9",labels = TRUE,label_color = "#E69F00") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(
    low = "white", high = "red", name = "Number of Brewery", label = scales::comma
  ) + theme(legend.position = "right") + ggtitle("Number of Breweries In Each State")

ggplotly(p1)

```

#### Observation: these states account for 32% of craft breweries in the United States, producing whopping close to 50% of all known craft beers in the country! These States are craft beer powerhouse!
- Colorado: 47 breweries
- California: 39 breweries
- Michigan: 32 breweries
- Oregon: 29 breweries
- Texas: 28 breweries






## Top producing companies in the top 5 states.
- looking deeper into top 5 states that have the most number of breweries
- Dissecting with companies information
- Which company produces the most craft beer or the most style of craft beer?
```{r, include=TRUE, cache = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Inputting data information

company=c("Brewery Vivant:62 beer:27 styles","Oskar Blues Brewery:46 beer:12 styles","Hopworks Urban Brewery:23 beer:9 styles","21st Amendment Brewery:20 beer:12 style","Southern Star Brewing Company:14 beer:7 style")

n=c(62,46,23,20,14)
top5companies=data.frame(company,state,n,lon,lat)

#plot using information gathered

plot_usmap(data = top5companies, regions = "state", values = "n", fill="indianred",color = "lemonchiffon",labels = TRUE,label_color = "#E69F00") +  
  
  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(data = top5companies,aes(x = lon, y = lat, label =company),size = 3, alpha = 0.8, label.r = unit(0.5, "lines"), label.size = 0.5,segment.color = "black", segment.size = 1)+
  geom_point(data = top5companies,aes(x = lon, y = lat, size = n),color = "navyblue", alpha = 0.5)+
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(5, 10),name = "Number of Craft Beer Made", label = scales::comma)+theme(legend.position = "right") + ggtitle("Top Performing Companies in the Country")
```

#### Observation: If we are planning an acquisition, 'Brewery Vivant' is definitely worth looking at, fun fact: Oskar Blue Brewery was bought by monster drink in 2022.
- 1. Company Brewery Vivant produce 62 beer with different 27 styles
- 2. Oscar Blues Brewery, CO: 46 beer, 12 styles 
- 3. Hopworks Urban Brewery, OR: 23 beer, 9 styles
- 4. 21st Amendment Brewery, CA: 20 beer, 12 styles
- 5. Southern Star Brewing Company, TX: 14 beer, 7 styles





## What is the most popular craftbeer style ?
- Dissecting even deeper
- Draw a bar chart counting the most number of beer style produced
- Observe the plot to look for insights
```{r}
#group by style
q=all%>%
  group_by(Style)%>%
  count()

#Print top 10 style
q=q[order(q$n,decreasing = TRUE),]
q=q[1:10,]

#plot the chart
q1=q%>%
ggplot(aes(x = Style, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0.4, vjust = 0.5,size = 6)) + theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,2,1), "lines"))+ggtitle("How Many Beer Are Produced in Each Style?") +ylab("Number of Beer")

ggplotly(q1)
```
#### Observation: American IPA seems to be the most popular style.

```

#### Observation: According to our research, Budweiser owns 11 craft beer businesses across 10 different states, they are:  

  

    - Appalachian Mountain Brewery, NC 

    - Breckenridge Brewery, CO 

    - Wynkoop Brewing Company, CO 

    - Cisco Brewers, MA 

    - Four Peaks Brewing Company, AZ 

    - Golden Road Brewing, CA 

    - Goose Island Brewery Company, IL 

    - Karbach Brewing Company, TX 

    - Platform Beer Company, OH 

    - Redhook Brewery, WA 

    - Widmer Brothers Brewing Company, OR 

  

- After a deeper look, only selected few produces "some" American IPAs, like the "Golden Road Brewing" company. 

  

- If our assumption is true, then Budweiser could introduce more American IPAs or purchase additional breweries that produce more American IPAs, WHICH LEADS TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTION. 

  

## Which company produces the most American IPA? 

- Deep dive into the findings from above 

- investigate the best performing companies producing the greatest number of American IPAs 

```{r, include=TRUE, cache = FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

#### Observation:
- Cigar City Brewing Company produces the most American IPAs, with 10 different American IPAs.
- Golden Road Brewing produces 9 different American IPAs
- Sun King Brewing produces 6 different American IPAs
- Two Beers Brewing Company produces 6 different American IPAs
- Oskar Blues Brewery produces 5 different American IPAs

## Conclusion

#### Findings & recommendations

After careful thought, we think that the state of Colorado, state of California, state of Michigan, state of Oregon, and state of Texas are worthy of investment in terms of producing craft beer 

If Budweiser is indeed considering expanding its craft beer business or acquiring, Suppose Budweiser is indeed considering expanding its craft beer business or acquiring, it. In that case, we think that companies like Brewery Vivant are typical thriving businesses that produce a large variety of craft beer across distinctive styles. 

Based on our assumption that if American IPA is the most popular craft beer style in the country, given the current Budweiser craft beer business portfolio, which is lacking craft beer businesses that produce different varieties of American IPAs, we give recommendations on introducing companies which are producing many American IPAs to strengthen its competitiveness.
